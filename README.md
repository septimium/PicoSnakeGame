## Description

This projects resembles the classic Snake Game from the old Nokia phones, having the same rules and mechanics. You control the Snake using a 2-axis joystick. Your score is updated live on a 4 digit display, that goes until 9999. For every interaction with "food", there is a buzzer which will play a sound. If you hit yourself, it's game over and you have to start again. You can also pass through walls. The game itself is displayed on an actual Nokia 5110 LCD display. Good luck and enjoy!
