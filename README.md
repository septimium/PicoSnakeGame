# Pico Snake Game
A game in rust that resembles the classic Snake Game from the Nokia 5110 phones era.

## Description

This projects resembles the classic Snake Game from the Nokia phones, having the same rules and mechanics. You control the Snake using a 2-axis joystick. Your score is updated live on a 4 digit display (maximum score is 9999, then it resets). For every interaction with "food", a buzzer will play a sound. If you eat yourself, it's game over and you have to start again. You can also pass through walls (surely a choice). The game itself is displayed on an actual Nokia 5110 LCD-like display. Good luck and enjoy!
